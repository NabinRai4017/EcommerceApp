### Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. For more detail click [here](https://redux.js.org)

### Redux Toolkit
Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app. Redux Toolkit builds in our suggested best practices, simplifies most Redux tasks, prevents common mistakes, and makes it easier to write Redux applications.

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. For more detail click [here](https://react.dev/reference/react)
